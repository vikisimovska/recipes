Ingredients

1 can of sweetened condensed milk
1 can (the same as the condensed milk can) of whole milk
4 eggs

Caramel sauce
250g white crystalized sugar

Or

6 tablespoons white crystalized sugar
½ cup water

Preheat the oven to 180C/375F. Put the sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, and eggs into a blender. Mix well and put aside to rest while making the caramel.

Caramel sauce
Sugar Only: Place the sugar in the pan that you will be baking the pudim in, or use an aluminum saucepan (stainless steel works too). Place over medium low heat and stir gently. Continue until you have a light syrup, making sure not to burn it. Remove from heat immediately.
Sugar & Water: Add the sugar and water to the pan you will be baking the pudim in, or use an aluminum saucepan (stainless steel works too). Place over medium low heat. When sugar starts to melt, stir gently and occasionally until the syrup starts to turn to a light-clear brown, remove immediately. Do not let it burn.

Banho-Maria
Place the baking pan with caramel sauce into a large baking tray. Pour in the mixture of sweetened condensed milk, whole milk, and eggs.  Set the whole assembly in the oven and then pour enough hot water into the large baking dish to come about halfway up the side of the pan with the pudim.

Bake for approximately 40 minutes, or until brown on the top and a toothpick comes out clean.

Leave to cool until room temperature. Turn the pudim onto a plate and put it into the fridge to cool for at least 1 hour.

Cleaning Tip: If your caramel sauce doesn’t work the first time or there is a lot of caramel sauce stuck to the baking pan, simple put water into the pan, put over medium heat until all the caramel has dissolved and then pour out. This is the easiest and most effective way to clean caramel from cookware.
